Made over the span of her seventy year career, Bourgeois‚Äô drawings are perhaps the most immediate of the artists‚Äôs works - often created late at night whilst suffering from insomnia, or as a kind of creative diary, the drawings explore universal and deeply emotional themes, all through the medium of doodling.",
